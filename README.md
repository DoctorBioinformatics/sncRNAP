##sncRNAP

A Nextflow  pipeline for the detection of novel as well as known differentially expressed ncRNA and miRNAs from sRNAseq datasets.

sncRNA identification pipelines often lack the capacity to determine those that are differentially expressed in control vs treated samples. sncRNAP is a tool that identifies differentially expressed ncRNAs in group comparisons.
